> Serious tech, silly shrimp. A demo of how **Anoma intents** can transform DEXs into fun, seamless experiences.

## 📖 What is ShrimpSwap?  
ShrimpSwap is a **lightweight, intent-centric decentralized exchange (DEX)** designed to showcase **Anoma’s intent architecture**.  
Instead of wrestling with AMMs or order books, users simply state their **intent**, and ShrimpSwap + solver magic handles the rest.  

In short:  
💬 *“I want to swap Token A for Token B at this range.”*  
🦐 Shrimp interprets your intent.  
⚡ Solver finds the best path.  
🎉 Swap happens. You smile.

## 🎨 Why ShrimpSwap?  
Because most DEXes feel like tax forms. ShrimpSwap feels like a **party under the sea** 🌊  

- 🦐 **Shrimp Mascots** – animated helpers make swaps fun.  
- ⚡ **Simple UI** – only essentials, no overload.  
- 🔮 **Intent-Centric** – powered by Anoma’s architecture.  
- 🛡️ **Privacy-friendly** – shielded swaps possible in future.

## 🔑 Features
- Express **swap intent** easily.  
- Shrimp animation for **solver process**.  
- Playful **result visualization** with confetti.  
- Cross-chain compatibility (demo simulated).  
- **Educational facts** about Anoma during swaps.

## 🧑‍💻 How it Works
1. **Frontend** – React + Tailwind + Framer Motion for a clean UI.  
2. **Mock Solver** – JSON file simulating solver responses.  
3. **User Flow** –  
   - Input → Intent created  
   - Shrimp swims → Finds liquidity  
   - Intent resolved → Swap complete 🎉
